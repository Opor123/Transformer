# **RC-Drone Transformer Project**


This project aims to develop a system capable of transforming an RC (Remote Controlled) vehicle into a fully autonomous drone and back, combining the functionalities of ground-based mobility and aerial navigation.  Due to time constraints, the initial phase will focus on core functionalities: ground driving and simple flight patterns.


## Project Objective

### Develop a modular system
    
 Design components for easy and reliable transition between RC and drone modes.  This modularity will be key for future expansion of the system's capabilities.


## Technical Approach

### Hardware
    
 Design and build a robust RC platform suitable for transformation into a drone.  This involves careful consideration of weight, power, and structural integrity to ensure stable flight and efficient ground movement.


### Software
    
 Develop software to seamlessly control the vehicle in both RC and drone modes. This includes implementing control algorithms for stable flight, responsive ground control, and smooth transitions between modes.

## Future work
 
 Future development will focus on implementing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms. This will enable autonomous navigation in both drone and RC modes, significantly enhancing the system's capabilities.  Further improvements may include more complex flight maneuvers and expanded sensor integration.

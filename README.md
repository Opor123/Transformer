**RC-Drone Transformer Project**
#

This project aims to develop a system capable of transforming an RC (Remote Controlled) vehicle into a fully autonomous drone and back, combining the functionalities of ground-based mobility and aerial navigation.
#

***Project Objective***

**Develop a modular system**
    
    Design components for easy transition between RC and drone modes.
#

***Technical Approach***

**Hardware**
    
    Make a capable RC design that will suitable for transform into drone.


**Software**
    
    Make a RC suitable for controlling whatever on the ground or hovering in the air.
